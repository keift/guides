Antivirus programs can corrupt GoodbyeDPI and make it unusable. If you have previously downloaded GoodbyeDPI while your antivirus program was running, you will need to delete it and download it again.

## 2. Download GoodbyeDPI

Press **Win + R** and type `cmd`.

```shell
# Go to the documents directory
cd %userprofile%/Documents

# Download the compiled zip file from GitHub
curl -Lo goodbyedpi-v1.1.zip https://github.com/keift/goodbyedpi/archive/refs/tags/v1.1.zip
```

## 3. Unzip the zip file

Extract the zip file and then delete it.

```shell
# Unzip the zip file
powershell -Command "Expand-Archive -Path './goodbyedpi-v1.1.zip' -DestinationPath './goodbyedpi-v1.1'"

# Delete the zip file that we no longer need
del goodbyedpi-v1.1.zip
```

## 4. Install GoodbyeDPI
