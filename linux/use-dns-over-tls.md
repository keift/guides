sudo dnf install -y systemd-resolved
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm systemd-resolved
sudo zypper -n install systemd-resolved

# Enable and start Systemd-Resolved
sudo systemctl enable systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl start systemd-resolved

# Configure Systemd-Resolved
sudo tee /etc/systemd/resolved.conf &>/dev/null << EOF
[Resolve]
DNS=1.1.1.1#one.one.one.one
DNS=2606:4700:4700::1111#one.one.one.one
DNS=1.0.0.1#one.one.one.one
DNS=2606:4700:4700::1001#one.one.one.one

DNSOverTLS=yes
EOF

# Make /etc/resolv.conf a symlink to Systemd-Resolved file
[ -f /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf ] && sudo ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

# Restart Systemd-Resolved for the changes to take effect
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```

## ALTERNATIVE: Google DNS

We are using Google DNS here.

```shell
# Install Systemd-Resolved

sudo dnf install -y systemd-resolved
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm systemd-resolved
sudo zypper -n install systemd-resolved

# Enable and start Systemd-Resolved

sudo systemctl start systemd-resolved

# Configure Systemd-Resolved

DNS=2001:4860:4860::8888#dns.google
DNS=8.8.4.4#dns.google
DNS=2001:4860:4860::8844#dns.google

DNSOverTLS=yes
EOF

# Make /etc/resolv.conf a symlink to Systemd-Resolved file

## TIP: Remove DNS settings

You can remove it as follows.

```shell
# Enable and start Systemd-Resolved
sudo systemctl enable systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl start systemd-resolved

# Leave the Systemd-Resolved configuration blank
sudo tee /etc/systemd/resolved.conf &>/dev/null <<< ""

# Make /etc/resolv.conf a symlink to Systemd-Resolved file
[ -f /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf ] && sudo ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

# Restart Systemd-Resolved for the changes to take effect
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```
